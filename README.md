# Coauthors

This GitHub repository is for analyzing publicly available data on coauthor relationships of faculty members at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES). 
The code is available, but data folders with the faculty lists are kept offline. 
Visualized results are available on RPubs: 
More details below.

1. Use **getcoauthors.R** to load a list of faculty members with their Google Scholar IDs (save the scraped data for the current date), then process the data to create a network of coauthors (save the processed data).
2. Use **coauthors.Rmd** to load the processed data, analyze and visualize it from the network perspective. Share the generated HTML file on RPubs.
